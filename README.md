# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for invalid or missing request body data in POST requests.

The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with proper error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks validation and error handling for the request body. If a client sends a malformed request or no data at all, the application might crash or produce unexpected results.  Robust applications should always validate input and handle potential errors gracefully.

## Solution

The solution involves adding checks to ensure the request body contains the expected data and handling cases where data is missing or invalid.  This prevents unexpected application crashes and provides informative error messages to the client.
